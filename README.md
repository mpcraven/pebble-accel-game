Note: The .png graphics need to compile can be found zipped in the Issues tab.
Also: The .pbw file to upload to the watch is also included the zip, as an alternative to building (SDK2 Pebble or Pebble Time).

// accel_game_1
// Pebble game with disc(s) - controlled with accelerometer - and blocks to hit with the disc(s)
// Adapted from accel-discs Pebble example https://github.com/pebble-examples/feature-accel-discs/
// Fill blocks by hitting with disc for 1,2 or 4 points depending on level, avoiding special X block -10 points
// Level designs include whole or partial bricks to hit & fill, multiple discs, varying disc size, varying speed.
// 54 levels, one new level per minute, after which the levels repeat.
// Compiled and tested for Pebble/Pebble Steel.
// Not optimised for, nor tested on, Pebble Round, and not tested on Pebble Time.
